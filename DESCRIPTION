    dispersions (NBID)
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Wenan Chen, Yan Li
Maintainer: The package maintainer <wenan.chen@stjude.org>
Description: This package provides functions for modeling 
    UMI based single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) data. It includes functions for 
    model fitting and goodness of fit tests with different distributions. 
    It also provides a function for differential expression analysis between 
    groups using negative binomial with independent dispersion parameters for 
    each group.
